# Azure’s four-tier storage model

 Options designed to accommodate varying data access patterns and cost requirements. These tiers—Hot, Cool, Archive, and Premium—allow you to balance performance needs with budget by selecting the right storage level for each dataset. Here’s a breakdown of each tier’s purpose and cost structure:

## 1. **Premium Tier**:
   - **Use Case**: Designed for applications requiring high-performance storage with low-latency access, such as mission-critical databases, transaction-heavy applications, or VM disk storage.
   - **Performance**: Optimized for low-latency access with high IOPS (input/output operations per second).
   - **Cost**: Higher cost per GB compared to other tiers due to the performance boost. Pricing includes costs for storage only, with no additional charges for access.
   - **Redundancy Options**: Locally redundant storage (LRS) or zone-redundant storage (ZRS) for reliability within a region.

## 2. **Hot Tier**:
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for frequently accessed data or data that needs immediate access, such as active files or content delivery.
   - **Performance**: High-performance tier, though not as fast as Premium. Designed for workloads with regular access patterns.
   - **Cost**: Higher storage cost per GB compared to the Cool and Archive tiers, but lower than Premium. However, access costs (for reading data) are relatively low.
   - **Redundancy Options**: Available with LRS, ZRS, Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), or Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS).

## 3. **Cool Tier**:
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for infrequently accessed data with flexible availability requirements, such as backups, archived data, or datasets stored for compliance.
   - **Performance**: Moderate access performance, lower than Hot and Premium. Designed for workloads with occasional access.
   - **Cost**: Lower storage costs per GB than the Hot tier but has a higher per-access charge (for reads). Ideal when data is rarely accessed but still needs to be readily available when needed.
   - **Redundancy Options**: Similar to the Hot tier, including LRS, ZRS, GRS, and RA-GRS.

## 4. **Archive Tier**:
   - **Use Case**: Best for long-term storage of data that is rarely accessed, such as compliance records, historical data, or long-term archives. Archive data requires rehydration (data retrieval) before it can be accessed.
   - **Performance**: Lowest-performance tier, as data retrieval can take hours depending on rehydration priority (Standard or High). Best for data where low access latency is not required.
   - **Cost**: Significantly lower storage cost per GB, the lowest among all Azure storage tiers. However, retrieval costs are higher, and there are fees for early deletion if data is moved out before a minimum retention period.
   - **Redundancy Options**: Supports LRS, GRS, and RA-GRS for redundancy.

## **Choosing Between Tiers**:
Selecting the appropriate tier depends on how frequently you need to access the data and your cost tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:
- **Use Premium for low-latency, high-performance needs**.
- **Use Hot for frequently accessed data** where access cost is low but storage cost is manageable.
- **Use Cool for infrequently accessed data**, where storage cost savings offset higher retrieval costs.
- **Use Archive for long-term storage** with minimal retrieval needs.

Azure’s flexibility to move data between these tiers also helps optimize costs based on changing access patterns, making it easier to maintain a cost-effective and high-performance storage strategy.
